The pilot flies in circles and performs fast circular "funnels".

As the speed of the circles increases, a steeper pitch attitude must be maintained in order to generate sufficient centripetal acceleration.
At high speeds, this maneuver is known as a "funnel", and results in a high load (G-force) on the helicopter.

Note:  frequent vision outages occur in this dataset where the pilot accidently flies outside of the area within our cameras' views.
       Most of these outages should be short, but may result in poor state estimates.
